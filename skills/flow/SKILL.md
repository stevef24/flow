# Flow

AI-assisted development with checkpoints.

## Commands

- `/flow:research` - Investigate codebase
- `/flow:plan` - Create implementation plan  
- `/flow:implement` - Execute with checkpoints

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Features touching multiple files
- Bugs needing investigation
- Refactoring with clear scope

**Skip for:**
- Quick one-file fixes
- Typos
- Simple config changes

## The Principle

Developer drives. AI amplifies.

- Research = your investigation, structured
- Plan = your design, formalized
- Implement = your code, generated with checkpoints
